# Compiling The Code

There are multiple methods for compiling and running this code:

- Launch the executable `Algorithm_Design_Homework\cmake-build-debug\Algorithm_Design_Homework.exe` by browsing to it in File Explorer or by using the Command Prompt. 

- Compiling the code with the [MinGW compiler](https://www.mingw-w64.org/downloads/) (or any other), which must be installed locally; After installation, set a System Variable Path to MinGW's `bin` folder. To see if the installation worked, open Command Prompt and type `gcc --version`. If it worked, go to the root directory `Algorithm_Design_Homework` and run `gcc -o main.c utils.c`. 

- In any compatible IDE, create a `blank project` and import the following files:`main.c`, `utils.c` and `utils.h`.
